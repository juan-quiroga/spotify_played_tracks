### We create a data pipeline for Spotify data.

**main.py**

This small program downloads the data from my Spotify listened songs. We can modify the time lapse in which this information is extracted (i.e it can be the last 24 hours, or more).

**my_played_tracks.sqlite**

Once we have done that, we proceed to store that information in a database, called my_played_tracks.
